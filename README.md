## üéØ Introduction

This project aims to make medical reports more understandable for non-experts using Large Language Model (LLM) prompting techniques.

## üìù LaTeX Code for Structured Prompts

```latex
\noindent\rule{\linewidth}{0.4pt}
`` I have \{n\} examples of original findings. Add your notions in place of XXXX. Strictly DO NOT SUGGEST MEDICINES and PRACTICES.
The prompt is constructed iteratively as follows:
$\text{prompt} \mathrel{+}= ``\{j\}. \{text\} \backslash n"$\footnote{$j$ is the index of the current iteration and $text$ represents the original findings from IU X-Ray dataset to be added.}
% This format allows for sequential numbering and newline separation of prompt components.}
% \textit{Note: }
\text{prompt}= For each finding, generate a more detailed fi nding for normal human understanding in 7 lines and output those in points
where $n = |\text{texts}|$. Then, for each $j \in [1, n]$:
$\text{prompt} \mathrel{+}= \text{``} \overbrace{j}^{\text{index}} \text{. }
\overbrace{\text{ordinal}_j}^{\text{ordinal number}} 
\text{: } \underbrace{\text{(detailed output)}}_{\text{placeholder}} \text{"}$ ''
\noindent\rule{\linewidth}{0.4pt}
```

### üîß Usage

This LaTeX code can be used to generate a structured prompt for analyzing medical findings, ensuring a consistent format and detailed explanations without recommending specific treatments.

## üß¨ Biomedical Condition Embedding (BCE) Prompt

```
Instruction:
Analyze chest X-ray data. Provide:
1. Generate a more detailed finding for normal human understanding and non-healthcare 
professionals. 
2. Strictly DO NOT ADVISE MEDICINES and PRACTICES.

Input:

```

### üîß Usage

This prompt can be used with large language models or AI systems capable of interpreting medical imaging data to generate human-readable explanations of chest X-ray findings. It's designed to provide informative, yet non-prescriptive, insights suitable for general understanding.

## üîç Chain Prompting for Medical Keyword Extraction (CPMK-E)

```python
analysis_prompt = """
For each pair of original and detailed findings, provide the following analysis:
1. List the 5 most important keywords from the original finding.
2. List the 5 most important keywords from the detailed finding.
3. Rate the similarity on a scale of 1-10, where 10 is perfectly similar.
4. Briefly explain why you gave this similarity rating.
"""

for j in range(1, n+1):
    analysis_prompt += f"Original {j}: {original_j}\n\n"
    analysis_prompt += f"Detailed {j}: {detailed_j}\n\n"

analysis_prompt += """
Provide your analysis for each pair in the following format:
Pair X:
1. Original Keywords: [list]
2. Detailed Keywords: [list]
3. Similarity Rating: [1-10]
4. Explanation: [brief explanation]
"""
```

Where:
- `n = |texts| = |extracted_sections| - 1`
- `original_j ‚àà texts`
- `detailed_j ‚àà extracted_sections[1:]`

### üîß Usage

This CPMK-E outline can be used to generate prompts for analyzing and comparing original medical findings with their detailed counterparts. It's particularly useful for:

1. Extracting key information from medical texts
2. Comparing the similarity of original and detailed findings
3. Ensuring consistency in medical reporting and analysis

The resulting prompt can be used with language models or AI systems capable of processing and analyzing medical text data.

## üíª Code Implementation

Our project includes two main Python scripts that implement our novel approaches:

### CPIR-MR Implementation (cpir-mr.py)

This script implements the Chain Prompting for Improved Readability - Medical Reports (CPIR-MR) technique, our main contribution. Key features include:

- Utilizes the Google Generative AI package with the "gemini-1.5-flash" model.
- Processes original medical findings in batches to generate more detailed, human-readable reports.
- Implements prompt chaining and Chain of Thought (CoT) enhancements for improved output.
- Generates Simplified Medical Reports (SMRs) structured in 7-line summaries.

### MTD Dataset Creation (MTD_dc.py)

This script creates the Medical Text Dataset (MTD) used for training our multimodal text decoder. It incorporates Biomedical Condition Embedding (BCE) prompting. Key features include:

- Uses BLIP (Bootstrapping Language-Image Pre-training) for image captioning.
- Employs TorchXRayVision for X-ray image classification.
- Combines BLIP embeddings and classification results to create comprehensive prompts.
- Generates a CSV file with instructions, inputs, and outputs for training.

## üìä Datasets

Our project includes two important datasets in the `dataset` folder:

### 1. IU XRay SMR.xlsx

This file is an extension of the IU XRay dataset with CPIR-MR (Chain Prompting for Improved Readability - Medical Reports). It contains three columns:

- **Id**: Image ID from the original IU XRay dataset
- **Original Report**: The original report from the IU XRay dataset
- **CPIR-MR**: Simplified Medical Reports (SMRs) generated by our CPIR-MR prompting technique

This dataset demonstrates how our method transforms original medical reports into more understandable versions for non-experts.

### 2. MTD_Dataset.csv

The MTD (Medical Text Dataset) is used for fine-tuning Llama3.1 with our BCE (Biomedical Condition Embedding) Prompting technique. It includes:

- BLIP embeddings: Vector representations of medical images
- Classification results: Percentages for various medical conditions detected in the images

This dataset showcases the integration of image analysis (via BLIP embeddings) and medical condition classification in our prompting approach.

These datasets are crucial for understanding, replicating, and building upon our work in making medical reports more accessible to non-experts.
